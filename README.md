## Design:

The Desing of the website is made to ivite visitors to come to get to know the studio, the studio yoga approach and yoga styles, and to book classes and offers.
So I tried to do a simple web with lights colors, wich is easy to navigate through and pleasent at the same time, also Include some "motivational" pictures of practicioners doing some fancy yoga poses to show what they will be capable to learm if they decided to learm and practice yoga in the studio.

### Design Brief:

+ Color:

The main colors used in the web are: 

- light grey: considered the color of architecture, commerce and theory. Some psycologies studies agree the gray bring; neutrality, wisdom, intelligence, futuristic, resignation, stable, dignity, and compromise.

- Orange :  Orange is often described as an energetic color. It may call to mind feelings of enthusiasm and excitement. Because orange is a high-energy color, many sports teams use orange in their uniforms, mascots, and branding.

Also Orange is an attention getting color, highly stimulating and friendly. 

Characteristic that suit perfectly with the need and goals of the website.

The color orange is often associated with spiritual practices including meditation and compassion.

- White :  White represents purity or innocence. 

White is bright and can create a sense of space or add highlights. Designers often use the color white to make rooms seem larger and more spacious, and I tried to transmit the  inner space that

yoga can bring to the students using the color on the website, and the breathing space. 


- Links : The color of the Links to navigate in the ahimsa.html are blue with the porupose to made easy to users to identify that they are external links.

+ Typography:

- Ubuntu = H2 and H3 and H4

- Lato = Paragraphs

+ Images:

- Background Image/ Hero Image/ home page: I used a yoga bright picture of yoga studion class with the teacher of some students practicing yoga and smailing to each other. to invite New      students to try the experience, and transmit the space of peace that the studio can be.  

- Sections images: In the other sections I used images of yoga practicioners doing some fancy posses to try to create some motivation in  users, to invited them to start or keep oracticing yoga.

- Ahimsa image: I choose a picture where a practicioner is in a meditation pose, to transmit the spiritual part of yoga.
